Activity log shows a log of all important changes and events in your organization.

## What is activity log?

Activity log tracks:

- **Account changes**: When accounts are created, updated, or deleted
- **Integration changes**: When integrations are created, activated, deactivated, or modified
- **Member changes**: When members are added, removed, or their roles change
- **Subscription changes**: When subscriptions are started or canceled
- **Billing events**: Invoice updates and payment transactions
- **User actions**: Sign-ins and other user activities
- **Step changes**: When steps are created, updated, or deleted
- **Execution events**: When integrations run and logs are viewed

You may not be able to see all events in the activity log. The are scoped by multiple factors like the user role, the organization settings, and the event type. If you are missing an event that you think should be there or is important to audit for compliance or other reasons for your organization, contact us and we will look into it.

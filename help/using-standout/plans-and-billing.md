The Billing page shows your current plan, subscription details, invoices, and options to buy extra credits if you need more credits than your plan allows.

Only users with Admin role can view the Billing page. If your account is managed by a partner or agent you may not have access to the billing or plan options from us. Contact your partner or agent to get more information about your options.

## Understanding credits

Credits are used when integrations run:

- A integration run consumes 1 credit.
- Integrations that takes longer time to run may consume more credits. 1 credit per started 30 seconds of runtime.
- More advanced steps in the integration may consume additional credits. Like the iterator that consumes 1 credit per iteration.
- Each plan includes a monthly credit allowance
- Credits reset monthly
- You can buy extra credits if needed and those will most often have a longer validity than the plan credits.
- Unused credits expire at the end of the current subscription period or when the credit package expires.

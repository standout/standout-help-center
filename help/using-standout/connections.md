Connected accounts (also called connections) are the services you've linked to Standout, like Shopify, Fortnox, Stripe, or other integration partners. Each connection lets you react on events or perform actions on that service.

## Viewing accounts in the Accounts section

Go to the "Accounts" section in an organization to see all connected accounts.

- Each account shows its name and type
- The list shows accounts for the current organization
- Click on an account to see its details

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator roles can view account details. Users with Reader role cannot open accounts to see their details.

## Adding a new account

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can add new accounts.

1. Go to the Accounts page in an organization
2. Click "New account"
3. Select the account type (service you want to connect)
4. Follow the connection steps:
   - Enter required credentials
   - Authorize the connection
   - Confirm the connection
5. The account appears in your list

## Account details

If you have Admin or Collaborator role, you can open an account to see its details. When you open an account, you can see:

- **Name**: The account name
- **Type**: What service it connects to
- **Status**: Whether it's connected and working
- **Connection info**: Details about the connection
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the account

## Managing account settings

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can edit account settings. All users can view connection status, workflows, and errors if they can see the account details.

You can:

- **Edit**: Update account name or settings (Admin and Collaborator only)
- **View connection**: Check connection status
- **View workflows**: See which integrations use this account
- **View errors**: Check for any problems

## Account errors

If an account has errors, you'll see them in the account details:

- Errors show what went wrong
- Each error shows when it occurred
- Fix the underlying issue to resolve errors

## Removing accounts

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can remove accounts.

To remove an account:

1. Open the account
2. Click "Delete" or "Remove"
3. Confirm the removal

**Note**: Make sure no integrations are using the account before removing it.

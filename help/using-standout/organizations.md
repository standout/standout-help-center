## Editing an organization

**Note**: Only users with Admin role can edit organization details.

1. Go to the Organizations page
2. Click on the organization name
3. Click "Edit"
4. Update the fields you want to change
5. Click "Save" to apply changes

## Plan options

Organizations have different plan options:

- **Starter**: Basic plan with limited features
- **Pro**: More features and higher limits
- **Premium**: Full features and highest limits
- **Custom**: Tailored plan for specific needs

Some organizations can change their plan, others cannot. This depends on the organization settings and your contract with us.

If your account was created by a partner or agent you may have different plan options available to you. Your account may also be covered by the partner and then you may not have access to the billing or plan options from us. Contact your partner or agent to get more information about your options.

## Managing child organizations

Some plans allow creating child organizations:

- Child organizations inherit some settings from the parent
- They can have their own integrations and connections
- Connections can be shared from the parent organization to the child organization.
- Members can be invited to the child organization without the ability to access the parent organization.
- Use this to organize large organizations with multiple divisions or departments.

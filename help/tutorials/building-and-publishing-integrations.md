This guide explains how to build integrations step-by-step, create drafts, send them for review, and publish them.

## Creating a draft integration

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can create integrations.

When you create a new integration, it starts as a draft.

1. Go to the organization page
2. Click "New integration"
3. Choose a trigger (what starts the integration)
4. Add steps (actions to perform)
5. Configure each step
6. Save your work

The integration is saved as a draft until you publish it.

## Working with drafts

Draft integrations let you:

- Make changes without affecting the live version
- Test your changes
- Get feedback before publishing
- Work on multiple changes at once

## Sending for review

Before publishing, you can send your draft for review:

1. Open your draft integration
2. Click "Create review"
3. The draft is marked as pending review
4. Reviewers can view and comment on your changes

## Reviewing drafts

If you're asked to review a draft:

1. Open the review link
2. View the changes made in the draft
3. Add comments if needed
4. Approve or reject the draft

## Approving and rejecting

Reviewers can:

- **Approve**: Accept the changes and allow publishing
- **Reject**: Send it back with feedback
- **Comment**: Add notes about specific changes

## Publishing an integration

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can publish integrations.

Once approved (or if you have permission), you can publish:

1. Open your draft integration
2. Click "Publish"
3. The draft changes are applied to the live integration
4. The draft is removed after publishing

**Note**: Publishing replaces the current live version with your draft changes.

## Understanding draft changes

Drafts can include:

- **New steps**: Steps added to the integration
- **Modified steps**: Existing steps that were changed
- **Deleted steps**: Steps removed from the integration

All changes are shown clearly in the review view.

## Best practices

- Test your draft thoroughly before sending for review
- Add clear descriptions of your changes
- Respond to review feedback promptly
- Publish during low-traffic times if possible
- Keep drafts focused on specific improvements

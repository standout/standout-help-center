Members are the people who have access to your organization. You can invite members and assign them different roles.

## Viewing members

Go to the "Members" tab in an organization to see all team members.

- The list shows all members and their roles
- You can see who invited each member
- Already confirmed users get instant access and an email notification about the new invitation.
- Unconfirmed users appear with the note "awaiting confirmation" and get an email invitation to confirm their user account in order to access the organization.

## Inviting a new member

**Note**: Only users with Admin role can invite new members.

1. Go to the Members page

## Member roles

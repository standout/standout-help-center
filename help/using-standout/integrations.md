Integrations (also called workflows) automate tasks between different services. You can create, activate, and manage them from the Integrations page.

## Creating a new integration

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can create integrations.

1. Go to the organization page
2. Click "New integration"
3. Choose a trigger (what starts the integration)
4. Add steps (what actions to perform)
5. Configure the settings
6. Save the integration

## Active and inactive tabs

The Integrations page has two tabs:

- **Active**: Shows integrations that are currently running
- **Inactive**: Shows integrations that are paused

Switch between tabs to see different integration states.

## Integration status

Each integration shows its status:

- **Live**: The integration is active and running
- **Paused**: The integration is temporarily stopped
- **Draft**: The integration is being created or edited

## Searching integrations

Use the search field to find specific integrations:

1. Type the integration name in the search box
2. Results filter as you type
3. Click on an integration to open it

## Viewing integration details

**Note**: All users with Reader, Collaborator, or Admin role can view integration details.

Click on an integration to see:

- **Status**: Whether it's live or paused
- **Steps**: What the integration does
- **Runs**: History of when it ran
- **Settings**: Configuration options

## Activating and pausing

**Note**: Only users with Admin or Collaborator role can activate, pause, or delete integrations.

- **Activate**: Click "Activate" to start an integration
- **Pause**: Click "Pause" to temporarily stop an integration
- **Delete**: Remove an integration permanently (be careful with this)

## Managing integrations

You can:

- Edit integration settings (Admin and Collaborator only)
- View run history (all roles)
- Check logs for errors (all roles)
- Duplicate integrations (Admin and Collaborator only)
